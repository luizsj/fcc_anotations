const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    //do something (or nothing)
  if(condition here) {
    resolve("Promise was fulfilled");
  } else {
    reject("Promise was rejected");
  }
});

A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.

const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer represents a response from a server
  let responseFromServer;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount of time in your code
     (i.e. something asynchronous), often a server request. 
     When you make a server request it takes some amount of time, 
        and after it completes you usually want to do something with the response from the server. 
        This can be achieved by using the then method. 
        The then method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled with resolve. 
        Here’s an example:

const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to true to represent a successful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = true;
    
  if(responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data");
  } else {  
    reject("Data not received");
  }
});

makeServerRequest.then(result => {
  console.log(result);
})
makeServerRequest.catch(error => {
  console.log(error);
})
    o result no then é a resposta da função passada no resolve
        no caso , resolve devolve uma string que é armazenada em result
    o error no catch é a resposta da função passada no reject
        no caso, reject devolve uma string que é armazenada no error

    Resolve e Reject podem devolver qualquer coisa,
        é comum devolverem objetos, por exemplo
