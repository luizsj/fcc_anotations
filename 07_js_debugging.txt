JavaScript recognizes six primitive (immutable) data types: 
    Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol (new with ES6) 
    and one type for mutable items: Object. 
    Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.

        let seven = 7;
        let three = "3";
        console.log(seven + three); //73
        console.log(typeof seven);  //Number
        console.log(typeof three);  //String

assigning Functions
        function myFunction() {
        return "You rock!";
        }
        let varOne = myFunction;
        let varTwo = myFunction();        
    Here varOne is the function myFunction, 
        and varTwo is the string You rock!.
